The system consists of several interconnected components designed to handle ingestion, processing, storage, and delivery of trading data efficiently.

### Components

#### 1. **Reception Layer**
**Purpose:** Ingest raw data from external sources and decode it.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Connect to external endpoints (e.g., WebSocket, TCP).
  - Decode incoming data using configurable protocols (e.g., FIX, SBE).
  - Publish decoded events to the EventBus.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Support dynamic data source registration at runtime.
  - Add real-time metrics for monitoring data ingestion rates.

---

#### 2. **EventBus**
**Purpose:** Facilitate efficient inter-component communication.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Distribute events to all subscribers (e.g., Core Pipeline, Analytics Pipeline).
  - Ensure low-latency communication with a lock-free queue implementation.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Replace in-memory EventBus with a distributed pub/sub system (e.g., Kafka or NATS) for scalability and resilience.
  - Provide event priority queues for critical data.

---

#### 3. **Core Pipeline**
**Purpose:** Transform, process, and validate data.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Update order books and maintain consistent state.
  - Perform risk checks and calculations (e.g., EMA, regressions).
  - Emit processed events to downstream consumers.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Support configurable sharding to distribute workload across multiple threads or nodes.
  - Integrate real-time validation rules to catch anomalies early.
  - Enable on-the-fly reconfiguration of calculation parameters.

---

#### 4. **Storage Pipeline**
**Purpose:** Persist processed data for historical analysis and audit purposes.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Store data in a high-performance database (e.g., MongoDB, Postgres).
  - Implement memory-mapped files for near-real-time storage needs.
  - Maintain write-ahead logs for fault tolerance.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Introduce distributed storage with replication to ensure data availability.
  - Add compression for archived data to reduce storage costs.

---

#### 5. **Analytics Pipeline**
**Purpose:** Perform real-time analysis on processed data.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Generate derived metrics, trends, and alerts.
  - Support advanced statistical calculations and machine learning integrations.
  - Publish insights as new events for other components to consume.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Enable dynamic addition of analytical rules through a centralized configuration service.
  - Integrate anomaly detection models for preemptive insights.

---

#### 6. **Protocols**
**Purpose:** Handle encoding and decoding of data formats.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Standardize communication across components using FIX, SBE, or custom formats.
  - Ensure seamless interoperability with external systems.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Add plugin support for easily extending the architecture to handle new protocols.

---

#### 7. **Common Utilities**
**Purpose:** Provide shared infrastructure and utilities.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manage CPU pinning and runtime configurations for optimal performance.
  - Expose low-level utilities like byte manipulation and checksum validation.
  - Centralize configuration management for the entire architecture.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Introduce a real-time configuration management system (e.g., Consul, ZooKeeper).
  - Implement unified logging and tracing for better observability.

## Event Flow

1. **Ingestion:** The Reception Layer ingests raw data, decodes it, and publishes structured events to the EventBus.
2. **Processing:** The Core Pipeline processes events, updates order books, performs calculations, and emits derived events.
3. **Storage:** The Storage Pipeline persists processed data for historical analysis or compliance purposes.
4. **Analytics:** The Analytics Pipeline analyzes events in real-time and generates insights or alerts.
5. **Delivery:** The system delivers processed data to consumers via WebSocket, pub/sub, or shared memory.

---

## Configuration

The architecture is highly configurable, supporting real-time updates without restarting the system.

### Configuration File Structure
```toml
[data_sources]
[source1]
type = "websocket"
endpoint = "wss://example.com/marketdata"
data_format = "FIX"
fields = ["symbol", "price", "volume"]

[processing]
ema_window = 10
use_mock_data = true

[delivery]
method = "pubsub"
target = "redis://localhost:6379"
```

### Real-Time Configuration Management
- Use Consul or ZooKeeper for centralized configuration storage.
- Enable hot-reloading of the configuration for minimal downtime during updates.
