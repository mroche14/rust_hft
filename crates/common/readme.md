# common Crate

## Overview

The `common` crate provides shared utilities and foundational components for the entire high-frequency trading system. It contains architecture-agnostic helpers that can be used by multiple crates (e.g., `core_pipeline`, `reception_layer`, `analytics_pipeline`, etc.).

These utilities emphasize minimal overhead, efficient memory operations, and architecture-specific optimizations. The goal is to avoid duplicating basic functionality (like byte conversions, atomic operations, or CPU feature detection) across different parts of the system.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **CPU Feature Detection:**
   Detect and expose CPU-specific features (like AVX instructions) that can be leveraged for optimization in performance-critical code. This can be crucial in high-frequency trading environments where every microsecond matters.

2. **Byte-Level Utilities:**
   Provides endian-safe conversions and other low-level byte manipulation helpers. Since market data protocols often rely on binary formats, correct and efficient byte handling is a must.

3. **Atomic and Lock-Free Helpers (Future Scope):**
   Although not fully implemented in this scaffold, this crate may house common atomic operations, memory ordering utilities, and patterns for building lock-free data structures.

## Design Goals

- **Minimal Dependencies:** Keep this crate lightweight and free of heavyweight dependencies to avoid bloat in the hot path.
- **Performance-Focused:** Functions should be carefully profiled and implemented to avoid unnecessary overhead.
- **Reusability:** Code here should be general enough to apply to different pipelines and layers of the system.

## Example Usage

- The `core_pipeline` crate might use `byte_utils` to parse incoming binary messages safely and efficiently.
- The `analytics_pipeline` might use CPU feature detection to optimize certain math operations if AVX is available.

## Status

This crate is under continuous improvement. Future work may add more specialized atomic utilities and SIMD-accelerated numeric operations.
