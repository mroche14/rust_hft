//! match_engine.rs
//! Matches incoming orders (buy/sell) against the order book to produce trades.
//!
//! # Key Concepts
//! - On a buy order: match against the ask side.
//! - On a sell order: match against the bid side.
//! - Generate fills and possibly partial fills.
//!
//! # Performance
//! - Operations should be constant or logarithmic time.
//! - Avoid locks: updates happen in a single-threaded context if possible.
