# Shared Memory in High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

Shared memory is a critical concept in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) systems, where ultra-low latency and high throughput are paramount. This document ties together the various components we've discussed, including CPU architecture, NUMA optimization, vectorized computation, and other advanced techniques, to illustrate how shared memory can be leveraged for peak performance in HFT.

## **1. What is Shared Memory?**

Shared memory refers to a memory segment that is accessible by multiple threads or processes. It allows for rapid communication and data sharing between computation units, minimizing the overhead associated with inter-process communication (IPC).

### **Advantages in HFT**
- **Low Latency**: Avoids the delays of message passing.
- **High Throughput**: Threads/processes can directly access shared data without unnecessary copying.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Reduces memory duplication across threads.

## **2. Shared Memory and CPU Architecture**

### **Relevance of CPU Architecture**
- **Registers** and **caches** (L1, L2, L3) act as the fastest shared memory levels within a core or among cores.
- **NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)** optimizes memory access across multiple CPUs in a shared memory environment.

| **Memory Type**      | **Latency (Approximate)** | **Size (Order of Magnitude)** | **Shared Access**                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Registers**         | ~0.5-1 ns                | ~1 KB                         | Not shared; core-specific           |
| **L1 Cache**          | ~1-4 ns                  | 32-128 KB                     | Core-specific                       |
| **L2 Cache**          | ~4-14 ns                 | 256 KB-2 MB                   | Shared within the same core cluster |
| **L3 Cache**          | ~14-30 ns                | 8-64 MB                       | Shared across cores on the same chip |
| **NUMA-Local DRAM**   | ~60-100 ns               | GBs                           | Shared within a NUMA node           |
| **Remote DRAM**       | ~100-300 ns              | GBs                           | Shared across NUMA nodes            |

## **3. Shared Memory in Ring Buffers and Circular Buffers**

### **Ring Buffers and Circular Buffers**
- A **ring buffer** is a fixed-size buffer that overwrites old data when full. It is often used for handling market data feeds in HFT systems.
- A **circular buffer** is similar but optimized for multiple producers and consumers with lock-free mechanisms.

### **Key Characteristics for Shared Memory in Buffers**
- **Efficient Write/Read Access**: Shared memory allows producers (data feeders) and consumers (traders/analytics) to access the buffer concurrently.
- **NUMA Optimization**: Allocating buffers to NUMA-local memory ensures minimal latency for threads on the same node.
- **Lock-Free Mechanisms**: Use atomic operations (e.g., `fetch_add`) to manage read/write pointers without blocking threads.

## **4. NUMA Optimization for Shared Memory**

NUMA architectures allow systems to optimize shared memory access by reducing cross-node communication.

### **NUMA-Aware Shared Memory Management**
1. **Thread Affinity**:
   - Pin threads to specific CPU cores on the same NUMA node as their memory.
2. **Memory Affinity**:
   - Allocate shared buffers on the NUMA node local to the threads accessing them.
3. **Load Balancing**:
   - Distribute workloads across NUMA nodes to avoid contention and hotspots.

### **Example: Market Data Processing**
- Market data arrives via NICs (Network Interface Cards).
- Each NIC is bound to a specific NUMA node.
- Shared buffers for the NIC are allocated in NUMA-local memory for minimal latency.

## **5. Vectorized Computation in Shared Memory**

Vectorized computations allow systems to process multiple data points simultaneously, leveraging SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations.

### **Integration with Shared Memory**
- **Batch Processing**: Shared memory buffers can store batches of market data for vectorized operations.
- **Prefetching**: Data in shared memory can be prefetched into SIMD registers to reduce access latency.

### **Example: Price Updates**
1. Load a batch of prices from the shared memory buffer.
2. Apply vectorized operations to compute deltas or other metrics.
3. Write the updated values back to the buffer.

## **6. Challenges in Shared Memory Management**

### **Cache Thrashing**
- Occurs when multiple threads overwrite each otherâ€™s cache lines, leading to high latency.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Align data structures to cache line boundaries.
  - Pin threads to cores to maintain cache locality.

### **Memory Contention**
- Multiple threads accessing the same memory region can cause contention.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use separate memory regions for different threads.
  - Implement lock-free data structures.

### **Buffer Overwrites**
- Producers overwriting data before consumers process it.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Maintain a logical gap between read and write pointers.
  - Use modulo arithmetic to enforce boundaries.

## **7. Advanced Techniques in Shared Memory for HFT**

### **RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)**
- Enables direct memory access between nodes without CPU intervention.
- **Use Case**: Sharing market data or analytics results across NUMA nodes or servers in ultra-low latency systems.

### **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**
- A specialized cache for memory address translations.
- **Optimization**:
  - Use large pages (e.g., 2 MB or 1 GB) to reduce TLB misses.

### **Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM)**
- Allows threads to execute critical sections without locks, rolling back on conflicts.
- **Use Case**: Managing shared memory updates in order books or trading strategies.

## **8. Practical Implementation Example**

### **System Design**
- **Input**: Market data feed from multiple NICs.
- **Shared Buffer**: NUMA-local ring buffers for each NIC.
- **Processing Threads**: Pinned to cores on the same NUMA node as their buffer.
- **Output**: Processed data sent to the trading engine.

### **Code Example: Shared Buffer Setup**
```rust
let buffer_size = 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB
let shared_buffer = Arc::new(Mutex::new(RingBuffer::new(buffer_size)));

let producer_thread = std::thread::spawn({
    let buffer = Arc::clone(&shared_buffer);
    move || {
        // Producer logic here
    }
});

let consumer_thread = std::thread::spawn({
    let buffer = Arc::clone(&shared_buffer);
    move || {
        // Consumer logic here
    }
});

producer_thread.join().unwrap();
consumer_thread.join().unwrap();
```
