## **Module 9: Practical Implementation**

### **9.1 Example Configuration**
- **Hardware**:
  - NUMA system with 8 cores per node.
  - 1 GB ring buffer allocated per NUMA node.
- **Data Structure**:
  ```rust
  struct MarketData {
      timestamp: u64,
      symbol: [u8; 8],
      price: f64,
      volume: u32,
  }
  ```

### **9.2 Workflow**
1. **Data Arrival**:
   - Market data enters via a NUMA-local NIC.
2. **Processing**:
   - Preprocessing and inference handled by threads pinned to NUMA-local cores.
3. **Response**:
   - Results written to a NUMA-local shared buffer for downstream systems.
