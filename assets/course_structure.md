## **Module 1: Foundations of Computer Architecture**

### **1.1 Introduction to HFT and Computational Requirements**
- Overview of HFT systems.
- The importance of ultra-low latency and high throughput.
- Key metrics: latency, throughput, cycles per instruction (CPI).

### **1.2 CPU Fundamentals**
- **Clock Speed**: Determines the number of cycles per second (measured in GHz).
  - **Relevance**: Higher clock speeds reduce latency in HFT systems.
- **Instruction Pipeline**: The fetch-decode-execute cycle and its optimization.
- **Multithreading and Multicore Architectures**:
  - Threads vs. processes and resource sharing.
  - Specialized instruction sets (e.g., SSE, AVX).

### **1.3 Memory Hierarchy and Latency**
- Overview of memory types and their latency:
  | **Memory Type**      | **Latency (Approx.)** | **Size (Order of Magnitude)** | **Relevance in HFT**                          |
  |-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | **Registers**         | ~0.5-1 ns            | ~1 KB                         | Fastest access for immediate computations.    |
  | **L1 Cache**          | ~1-4 ns              | 32-128 KB per core            | Ideal for frequently accessed, small data.    |
  | **L2 Cache**          | ~4-14 ns             | 256 KB-2 MB per core          | Stores slightly larger, less frequently used data. |
  | **L3 Cache**          | ~14-30 ns            | 8-64 MB shared per chip       | Shared across cores, useful for inter-core communication. |
  | **NUMA-Local DRAM**   | ~60-100 ns           | GBs per NUMA node             | Provides high-speed access to large buffers.  |
  | **Remote DRAM**       | ~100-300 ns          | GBs per remote NUMA node      | Significant performance hit; avoid if possible. |
  | **Disk (SSD)**        | ~50-100 µs           | TBs                           | Not directly relevant for ultra-low latency operations. |
  | **Network Storage**   | ~100-500 µs          | TBs or PBs                    | Used for historical data, not real-time.      |

  ```rust
  struct MarketData {
      timestamp: u64,
      symbol: [u8; 8],
      price: f64,
      volume: u32,
  }
  ```

### **7.2 NUMA-Optimized Workflow**
1. Market data arrives via NICs, bound to NUMA-local memory.
2. Threads pinned to NUMA-local cores for processing.
3. Results written to NUMA-local ring buffers.

## **Module 8: Cache Thrashing and Mitigation**

### **What is Cache Thrashing?**
- **Definition**: When multiple threads or processes repeatedly overwrite each other’s data in shared caches (e.g., L3).
- **Impact**:
  - Increased cache misses.
  - Higher latency due to frequent memory accesses.

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Thread Affinity**:
   - Pin threads to specific cores to maintain cache locality.
2. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Divide data across NUMA nodes and cores to minimize contention.
3. **Cache Line Alignment**:
   - Align data structures to cache line boundaries to prevent false sharing.
