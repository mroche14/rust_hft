# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Systems: A Comprehensive Guide

## **1. Introduction to High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**

High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a form of algorithmic trading characterized by:
- Ultra-low latency.
- High transaction volumes.
- Short holding periods.

HFT systems leverage cutting-edge hardware, optimized software, and advanced algorithms to exploit market inefficiencies.

This course details the architecture and components of HFT systems, their placement, memory usage, threading models, and optimization strategies.

## **2. Components of an HFT System**

### **2.1 Network Interface**
#### **Function:**
- Interfaces with the exchange's servers to receive market data and send orders.
- Example: 10/25/100 Gbps Ethernet NICs with low-latency optimizations.

#### **Optimizations:**
- **Kernel-bypass technologies**: DPDK, RDMA.
- **Dedicated NIC Queues**: Reduce contention and improve throughput.
- **NUMA Binding**: Align NICs to the same NUMA node as the CPU processing its data.

---

### **2.2 Data Ingestion and Parsing**
#### **Function:**
- Processes raw market data feeds into structured formats for trading algorithms.
- Protocols: FIX, ITCH, OUCH.

#### **Memory Usage:**
- Lock-free circular buffers for feed storage.
- Direct memory access (DMA) from NICs.

#### **Threading:**
- Single thread per data feed to maintain sequence.
- NUMA-aware threading for locality optimization.

---

### **2.3 Strategy Engine**
#### **Function:**
- Hosts trading algorithms and decision-making logic.
- Analyzes parsed market data.

#### **Memory Usage:**
- **Instruction Cache**: Optimized for trading algorithms.
- **Data Cache**: Keeps critical variables like prices and positions close to the CPU.

#### **Threading:**
- Multi-threaded with affinity settings to reduce cache thrashing. Cache thrashing occurs when multiple threads or processes repeatedly access data that maps to the same cache lines, causing frequent eviction and reload of cache data. In HFT, this can result in significant performance degradation due to increased latency. By carefully setting thread affinity—binding specific threads to specific CPU cores—data locality is preserved, and contention on shared resources is minimized, leading to more predictable and efficient execution.
- Separate threads for different strategies.

### **2.4 Order Management System (OMS)**
#### **Function:**
- Sends and manages orders sent to the exchange. Management entails queueing orders for execution, prioritizing them based on strategy requirements, and retrying in case of errors or rejections. This process ensures that the orders are correctly synchronized with market conditions, maintaining the integrity and performance of the HFT system.

#### **Memory Usage:**
- FIFO queues or ring buffers for order storage. FIFO queues ensure that orders are processed in the exact sequence they are received, maintaining temporal integrity which is crucial in fast-moving markets. Ring buffers, on the other hand, are highly efficient for cyclic data storage and access, reducing memory fragmentation and ensuring low-latency operations. These structures are particularly relevant in HFT for minimizing contention and ensuring deterministic performance.

#### **Threading:**
- Dedicated threads for placing, modifying, and canceling orders. These threads are managed using thread-safe mechanisms such as atomic operations or mutexes to avoid data races. For example, the placement thread exclusively interacts with a queue of new orders, while the modification and cancellation threads access other dedicated queues. To optimize performance, each thread operates on a separate subset of data, reducing contention. Coordination is achieved using lightweight synchronization primitives and careful memory management to ensure minimal latency and consistent performance.
- Atomic operations for thread-safe access.

### **2.5 Risk Management**
#### **Function:**
- Ensures compliance with risk parameters before orders are executed.

#### **Memory Usage:**
- Shared memory for storing thresholds and limits.

#### **Threading:**
- Integrated with OMS threads for real-time checks.

---

### **2.6 Analytics and Metrics**
#### **Function:**
- Monitors system performance and trading outcomes.

#### **Memory Usage:**
- Persistent storage for logs.
- Shared buffers for live metrics.

#### **Threading:**
- Background threads for non-critical processing.
- Offloaded analytics to separate machines or processes.
